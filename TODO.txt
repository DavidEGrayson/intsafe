Some changes we might want to make to the proposed intsafe.h:

- Return a default/error value when conversion or math operation
  fails, to help prevent security issues in buggy callers that do not
  check the error value and use the result anyway.

- Define the types that are used as arguments, to make it more like
  the coreclr implementation.

- Don't use asserts on the output pointers, or perhaps turn off the
  assertion when NDEBUG is defined.
