headers/intsafe: Add missing MIN/MAX macros and fix Cygwin compatibility.

- MIN/MAX macros:
  - The first block was copied from stdint.h.
  - The second block was copied from limits.h, but typically GCC overrides them
    by installing its own limits.h, so we use ifndef for these ones.
  - The third block was copied from cfgmgr32.h.
  - The other blocks consist of definitions that we don't have
    in any other headers.
- In Cygwin (64-bit):
  - "long" is a 64-bit type, so we can't use it for DWORD_MAX
     since DWORD is 32-bit: use __MSABI_LONG to conditionally
	 add the "l" suffix.
  - GCC's limits.h provides 64-bit definitions for ULONG_MAX,
    LONG_MIN, and LONG_MAX.  We should avoid providing
	definitions that are different.
  - size_t (unsigned long) != UINT_PTR (unsigned long long)
  - ptr_diff_t (long)      != INT_PTR (long long)

These changes were tested with the test suite here:
